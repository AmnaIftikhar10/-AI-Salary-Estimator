- Predicts employee salary based on job position
- Trained using regression algorithms
- Flask-based backend for model deployment (`app.py`)
- Interactive development and analysis in Jupyter Notebook
- Clean and modular code (`model.py`)

üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- Flask
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
